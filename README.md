TODO
=====

- Add paging to search capability and to the listing of entries per a tag.


- Allow editing a comment (maybe for a limted time?)

Allow page to be written in Markdown (see format)

Register searches and let admin see them. (If they are searches limited to a
user, then maybe even let the user see them.)
Let them set preferred results for specific frequent search terms.

- When deleting a user ask for confirmation
  and remove all the posts and comments the user made.
- Allow disabling users (by administrators)
- ?? make sure the display names are unique as well (we probably don't want to let the readers be confused)


Show the personal picture of each user next to their post and next to their
comment (probably a smaller picture).


Allow login with some other services:
   Open ID (which is going away)
   Live Journal
   WordPress.com
   Google
   ???
